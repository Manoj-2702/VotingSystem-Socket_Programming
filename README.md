# VotingSystem-Socket_Programming

This project was done as a part of my CN Project. 
This project includes 
- Threading: The system is designed to handle multiple client connections concurrently using threading. This ensures efficient utilization of resources and allows multiple users to interact with the system simultaneously without blocking.

- Two-factor authentication using SMTP: The project implements two-factor authentication for user verification. Upon registration or login, users receive a verification code via email using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). This adds an extra layer of security to the voting system by requiring users to provide both their credentials and a verification code before accessing the system.

- MongoDB as a database: MongoDB is used as the database management system for storing user information, voting data, and other relevant details. MongoDB offers flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for managing large volumes of data efficiently.

- SSL fully secured voting: The voting process is secured using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL ensures that data exchanged between the client and server remains confidential and integral, protecting against eavesdropping and tampering.
